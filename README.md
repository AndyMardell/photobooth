# Photobooth

A python photobooth that runs on a Raspberry Pi and makes use of [gphoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/gphoto2/) and a USB connection to a Canon DSLR.

Press a big button, photobooth will take 4 photos, stitch them together into a tile, make an animated GIF, upload all of the files to a desired location (in my case, my home server which I then use to display them on the TV).
